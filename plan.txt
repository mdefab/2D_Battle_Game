player name gets inserted after user inputs username 
+ will also indicate fighter choice 
e.g. Michael - Tank , 
Nicholas - Bruiser, 
Carl - Athlete

player attack, defence, health, stamina stats will be affected by fighter choice
Tank - high defence, high health, low attack, average stamina
Bruiser - average defence, average health, high attack, average stamina
Athlete - average defence, average health, average attack, high stamina

Show an inventory box with items that are equipped.
Make stamina and health potions provide random amounts of restoration ranging from +10-50.
No defence when reaching for item

view listens for new game -> controller function passed as a handler into that listener and calls
model to update a new game with updated gameState depending on player choice
reset and new game buttons

keypress to bring up menu: perhaps esc


Done:
- make menu and overlay disappear after both users click ready
- implement guide button so guide appears on click and closes on click of close button.
- add guide info: should show fighter stats plus explanation of game
- guide will have highest z-index. change overlay z-index to be higher than game-menu when guide is open
- implement initializing of fighter class for backend model + modify image width depending on fighter choice (widest: tank, skinniest: athlete)
- implement gameView for tracking score/health/stamina/attack
- implement tracking of items picked up and items equipped in GameView (inventory images)
- implement game logic with death on health = 0
- implement post-game screen: victor/defeat text, score update
- new menu with fight again (resets fighter health/stamina/itemsEquipped/itemsAvailable but keeps score... perhaps new instance of class btn rounds to reset this data)
- reset button (window.location.reload()) for full refresh 
- button to change fighter choice before starting next round, but maintains game stats.
- change defence messages to show how much damage was blocked
- Fix bug where uesrs can escape end game menu and choose another move for one round. --> hide select boxes until start of next game.
- implement BaseFighter warcry so it gets displayed on keydown - 1p: "c" 2p: "m"
- button to see hotkey controls in menus
- button to see menu + indicate to press esc for menu
- add new fighter class to test extending app with new fighters: All you need to do is make the change in index.html
  select options to add the new fighter option and in model for initializeFighter options which initializes the choice with
  the new fighter class.
TODO:
- add ability to press keys instead of selecting with mouse so move choice is anonymous (e.g. player 1 is wasd and player 2 is ijkl)
- 
Future idea:
- add feature to select 1 or 2p and if 1p game, computer player auto chooses random choice except if user is below y health 
  and computer has stamina over x amount, then computer will attack
