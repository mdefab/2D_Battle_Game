Bonus:
- add new fighters for friends and myself
- add feature to select 1 or 2p and if 1p game, computer player auto chooses random choice.
- add feature to be able to press keys instead of selecting with mouse so move choice is anonymous (e.g. player 1 is wasd and player 2 is ijkl)
- add feature to change from ready to unready status if other player hasn't gone yet
