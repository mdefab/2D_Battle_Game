Done:
- make menu and overlay disappear after both users click ready
- implement guide button so guide appears on click and closes on click of close button.
- add guide info: should show fighter stats plus explanation of gam
-guide will have highest z-index. change overlay z-index to be higher than game-menu when guide is open
- implement initializing of fighter class for backend model + modify image width depending on fighter choice (widest: tank, skinniest: athlete)
- implement gameView for tracking score/health/stamina/attack
- implement tracking of items picked up and items equipped in GameView (inventory images)
- implement game logic with death on health = 0
- implement post-game screen: victor/defeat text, score update
- new menu with fight again (resets fighter health/stamina/itemsEquipped/itemsAvailable but keeps score... perhaps new instance of class btn rounds to reset this data)
-reset button (window.location.reload()) for full refresh 
-button to change fighter choice before starting next round, but maintains game stats.

 TODO:
-fix defence messages to show how much damage was blocked
- add new fighters with my name and friend's names
- implement BaseFighter warcry so it gets displayed on keypress of certain button (addEventListener); 1p: "c" 2p: "m"

Bonus:
- add new fighters for friends and myself
- add feature to select 1 or 2p and if 1p game, computer player auto chooses random choice.
- add feature to be able to press keys instead of selecting with mouse so move choice is anonymous (e.g. player 1 is wasd and player 2 is ijkl)
- add feature to change from ready to unready status if other player hasn't gone yet
